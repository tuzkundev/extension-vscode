# Clean Unused Code ‚Äì VS Code Extension

Tidy up your JavaScript / TypeScript projects with a single command.  
The extension sweeps the entire workspace, deletes dead code, and keeps the rest of your files squeaky-clean‚Äîwithout touching any `console.log` or `debugger` statements.

---

## ‚ú® What it can do

1. **Remove unused imports** (built-in _Organize Imports_ refactor).
2. **Remove variables that are declared but never read**.
3. **Remove functions that are never called** (top-level or exported).
4. **Remove React component props that are passed-in but never used**.
5. Cancellable progress bar, auto-save only when edits were made.
6. All rules are optional and can be toggled independently from the settings UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí "Clean Unused Code" (searchable), or edit _settings.json_:

```jsonc
{
  // package.json ‚Ä∫ configuration
  "cleanUnusedImports.removeUnusedVariables": true, // delete unused let/const/var
  "cleanUnusedImports.removeUnusedFunctions": true, // delete never-called functions
  "cleanUnusedImports.removeUnusedProps": false, // delete unused React props
}
```

Toggle any of them, re-run the command, and only the enabled rules are applied.

## üìö Usage Tips

‚Ä¢ **On-demand only** by design‚Äîbind the command to a custom key if you prefer.  
‚Ä¢ Combine with VS Code's "Format Document" on save for an all-in-one hygiene workflow.  
‚Ä¢ Running in CI? Use `code --install-extension` followed by `code --command extension.cleanUnusedImports` inside a headless VS Code instance (via `xvfb-run` on Linux).

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Will it delete my debug prints?**  
A: No. The extension explicitly ignores `console.*` calls and `debugger` statements.

**Q: Which languages are supported?**  
A: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx`. Support for more languages can be added via pull request.

**Q: How does it detect unused React props?**  
A: It parses each component with the TypeScript AST and checks prop identifiers against the component body, skipping any component that uses the spread operator (`...props`).

Happy coding & keep your project spotless!
